<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As to appeal to anime enthusiasts, the objective of this project is to create a Discord bot that provides anime-based utilities such as tracking and recommending show lists and displaying top current shows. The need for this project is essential to Discord users who hope to keep up with their shows, expand their show list by recommendations, and see what new anime everyone else is watching. This project is beneficial to fans as it will propagate the information they want to see and the data provided will allow for the user to figure out what anime they want to see or keep up with. If this project does not get built, that will be a missed opportunity for creating a Discord community unified by a common interest such as anime.
