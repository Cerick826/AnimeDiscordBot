## INTRODUCTION
* What is the project (non-technical description)?
	* As to appeal to anime enthusiasts, the objective of this project is to create a Discord bot that provides anime-based utilities such as tracking and recommending show lists and displaying top current shows. 

* What is the need for this project, impact, benefits?  What is the impact if this project doesn't get built?
	* The need for this project is essential to Discord users who hope to keep up with their shows, expand their show list by recommendations, and see what new anime everyone else is watching. This project is beneficial to fans as it will propagate the information they want to see and the data provided will allow for the user to figure out what anime they want to see or keep up with. If this project does not get built, that will be a missed opportunity for creating a Discord community unified by a common interest such as anime.

* Who will use the output of this project?
	* Anime enthusiasts that would like to build a community in Discord.
	
* The resources you will need, human, machine, other?
	* We will need a compatible operating system, Discord software application, Discord open source API, streaming (video) data, and humans such as anime fans. 

* What process/methodology will you use?
	* The methodology we deem to be optimal for use in this project is the waterfall process.

* What is the schedule for the project and it's milestones?
	* Iteration 1 (Week 3-5): Learn to create a Discord bot and Learn/Review Python
	* Iteration 2 (Week 6-8): Create Watch List
	* Iteration 3 (Week 9-12): List Stats (Episode Tracker)
