                    <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
                    <p> As to appeal to anime enthusiasts, the objective of this project is to create a Discord 
                        bot that provides anime-based utilities such as tracking and recommending show lists and 
                        displaying top current shows. The need for this project is essential to Discord users who 
                        hope to keep up with their shows, expand their show list by recommendations, and see what 
                        new anime everyone else is watching. This project is beneficial to fans as it will propagate 
                        the information they want to see and the data provided will allow for the user to figure out 
                        what anime they want to see or keep up with. If this project does not get built, that will be a 
                        missed opportunity for creating a Discord community unified by a common interest such as anime.
